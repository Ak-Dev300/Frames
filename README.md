# HNG-X-stage-3-task

A responsive image gallery web app showing static images from local database.

In the app you can choose from the tags at the transparent nav bar, which category of images to display. 
It has a drag and drop feature where individual images can be dragged and dropped. I used the "react-beautiful-dnd" to achieve this
Finally a clickable log out button.
